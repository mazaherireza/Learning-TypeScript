... I don't have to rerun this command here.

So to get rid of that we can enter watch mode.
... we can tell TS to watch file and whenever that file changes, TS will recompile.
--watch at the end

tsc app.ts --watch or
tsc app.ts -w

DON'T quit this watch mode process whilst developing.
You can quit thereafter via CTRL + C.

The downside is that we still have to specifically target this file here...
