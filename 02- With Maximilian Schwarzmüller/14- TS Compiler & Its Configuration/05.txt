Understanding TS Core Libs
--------------------------
lib is an option that allows you to specify which default objects and features TS notes.

... working with the DOM ...

app.ts
------
const button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener(); <-------- ... TS doesn't know for sure whether we find a button here.

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('Clicked!');
})

... button is something which has an addEventListener method? 	

You could be writing your Node.js application with TS and there indeed this would all not work.

... we can workaound that with an ! after ...
...querySelector('button')!; <----- ... don't worry such a button will exist, we will get a value here.

How does it ... such a document constant or variable available?

If it's not set, the defaults depend on your JS target.
... it assumes that all DOM APIs are available.

If the lib options not set some defaults are assumed
