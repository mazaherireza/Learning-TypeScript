Stop Emitting Files on Compilation Errors
-----------------------------------------

"noEmitOnError" option <------------- **
... the default is false.

! mark
Now even though we don't fully understand what's going on
The problem here simply is that TS does not know ... have a button here 
after all when querying for a button we might not get one.

So even if we have an error, TS creates a JS file <------------- **

false ... in your JS file, if you have an error.

If you set this to true however what will happen is that problematic files will not be generated.
