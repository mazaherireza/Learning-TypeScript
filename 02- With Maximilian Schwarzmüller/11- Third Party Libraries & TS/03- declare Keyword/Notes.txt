What do you do if you have a library where you can't install types as we did it for Lodash?

index.html
----------
...
<script>
  var GLOBAL = "Something"; <----- will be available globally ... added to the global Window object 
</script>

index.ts
---------
...
console.log(GLOBAL); <--------- Utilize from inside TS code.
...
In such cases you have ... in TS and ... declare command.

declare var GLOBAL: any; <------- This tells TS don't worry, it will exist.

"declare" allows us to declare TS features or variables where you know that they exist
or let TS know about packages global variables in general which TS can't know but you as a developer 
know that they will be there.
