... waterfall on the right.
Every HTTP request that needs to be made, of course takes a litte time.

What is Webpack?
Webpack is a bundling & "Build Orchestration" Tool
... helps us to reduce the amount of HTTP requests by bundling code together ...
... optimize our code, ... allows us to add more build steps ...
