In webpack-dev-server mode, the bundle is generated in memory only, 
... it's now actually written to the disk ... reload page, ... crashes.
The problem just is things are not wired up correctly at the moment	

webpack.config.js

...
module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.ts",
  ...
  output: {

    publicPath: "dist" <--------- Is needed for webpack-dev-server

... by default webpack-dev-server serves and index.html file 
... doesn't make the connection to the dist folder correctly which is why we have to inform
webpack-dev-server with publicPath where to find our assets
