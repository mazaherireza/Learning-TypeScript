outdir and rootdir 
------------------
... file lies around here in your root level project folder.

The dist folder has the job of holding all the output, so all the JS files ...
and the source folder might hold all our TS files.

If we set outDir, we can tell the TS compiler where the created files should be stored.
we could set this to dist

"outDir": "./dist",

JS files are placed in dist folder.

index.html
----------
<script src="dist/app.js" defer></script>

"rootDir": "./src",

But with rootDir the TS compiler will not just look only at the source folder it also makes sure that 
the project structure you set up there, is kept in this folder.

... where your output files would be generated.
