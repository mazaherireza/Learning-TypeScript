tsconfig.json <--------------- a crucial file for managing this project.
It essentially tells TS how it should compile these files. <------------ **

tsconfig.json
-------------
...
"exclude": ["analytics.ts"]
... we want to exclude analytics.ts from compilation

You can also work with wildcards ... 

"exclude": ["*.dev.ts"]

"exclude": ["node_modules"]

... I don't want to compile any TS files I might have inside of node modules.

... node_modules is automatically excluded as a default setting.

"incldue": []
... which files you want to include in the compilation process and 
anything that's not listed here will not be compiled.

"files"
This allows you to point at the individual files so it's a bit like include 
with the different that here you CAN'T specify whole folders what you want to include instead.
