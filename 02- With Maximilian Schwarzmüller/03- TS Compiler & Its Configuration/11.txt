let appId = "ABZS1001"

... allowed ... because TS can't know if you may be need that globally defined value in a numbers script file 
so therefore this is allowed but in a function where there is no other place 
where you could needed TS will complain now if you have unused code.

noImplicitReturns means that we'll get an error if we have a function that sometimes 
returns something and sometimes it does not.

function add(n1: number, n2: number) {
  if(n1 + n2 > 0) {
    return n1 + n2;
  }
  return <---------- We at least have to deliberately not return anything here by adding the return keyword 
                     just omitting it is not allowed here 
}

TS detects that not all branches in this function lead to return statement 
and because of our setting that's not allowed.
