... connected by TS or by the browser or by some third party build tool and not by you.
By merging them all into one file during development.

What are our options when we want to split code into multiple files?
... 3 options for that.

...
For bigger projects we have 2 main options.
... namespace and file bundling.
namespace <------ a TS feature ... add special code to your code 
group code to gather below a namespace and then import namespaces into other files

ES6 imports and exporst (ES6 modules)
... download separately which means more HTTP requests ... therefore you can bundle files together 
to work on multiple files during development but ship a single file for production
but you need third party tools for that
