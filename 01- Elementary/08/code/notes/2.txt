Array Type Annotations
----------------------
The TypeScript type annotation for array types is fairly straightforward: 
we put [] after the element type. <------------ **

In this code, names is an Array that can only contain strings:
let names: string[] = ['Danny', 'Samantha'];

An alternative method is to use the Array<T> syntax, where T stands for the type.
let names: Array<string> = ['Danny', 'Samantha'];
In the code above, the type, T, is string.
