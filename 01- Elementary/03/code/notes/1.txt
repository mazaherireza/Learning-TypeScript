Variable Type Annotations
-------------------------
In some situations, we'd like to declare a variable without an initial value 
while still ensuring that it will only ever be assigned values of a certain type. 

If left as any, TypeScript won't be able to protect us from 
accidentally assigning a variable to an incorrect type that could break our code. <--------- **

We can tell TypeScript what type something is or will be by using a type annotation.

Variables can have type annotations (also known as type declarations) added just after their names. 
We provide a type annotation by appending a variable with a colon (:) and the type (e.g., number, string, or any).

let mustBeAString : string;
mustBeAString = 'Catdog';
 
mustBeAString = 1337;
// Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'

... they get automatically removed when compiled to JavaScript.
