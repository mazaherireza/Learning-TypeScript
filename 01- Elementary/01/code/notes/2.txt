First, we write TypeScript code in files with the extension .ts. 
Next, we run our code through the TypeScript transcompiler. <----------- **

The transcompiler will check that the code adheres to TypeScriptâ€™s standards, 
and it will display errors when it does not.

If the TypeScript code can be converted into working JavaScript, 
the transcompiler will output a JavaScript version of the file (.js). <---------- **

TypeScript code is a superset of JavaScript code, 
it has all the features of traditional JavaScript but adds some new features.

...
The TypeScript transcompiler can be used on the command line by running the tsc command: 
tsc

This will create an equivalent .js file in the same directory as well as 
surface any errors found by the TypeScript transcompiler.

index.ts
---------
console.log('Hello, world!');

bash
$ tsc
$ ls

index.js index.ts tsconfig.json

Run the resultant JavaScript file with the node command: node index.js

$ node index.js
'Hello, world!'
