Union Types
-----------
Defining Unions

Unions allow us to define multiple allowed type members by separating each type member 
with a vertical line character |. 

let ID: string | number;
 
// number
ID = 1;
 
// or string
ID = '001';

In this example, string | number is a union that allows ID to be a string or a number. 
It's more flexible than a single primitive type, but much more specific than the any type.

Unions can be written anywhere a type value is defined, including function parameters:

function getMarginLeft(margin: string | number) {
  return { 'marginLeft': margin };
}

Using unions to type function parameters is especially convenient 
because functions often need to handle multiple types of input.
