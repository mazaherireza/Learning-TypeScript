Object Types
------------
let aPerson: {name: string, age: number};

The type annotation looks like an object literal, 
but instead of values appearing after properties, we have types. 

Notice that the variable aPerson has yet to be assigned a value. **
Trying to assign a value to aPerson that doesn't have name and age properties of the specified types 
will lead to a type error:

TypeScript places no restrictions on the types of an object's properties. 
They can be enums, arrays, and even other object types!

let aCompany: {
  companyName: string, 
  boss: {name: string, age: number}, 
  employees: {name: string, age: number}[], 
  employeeOfTheMonth: {name: string, age: number},  
  moneyEarned: number
};
