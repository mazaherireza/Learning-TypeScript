Composed Types
--------------
...
We can define multiple types and reference them inside other types. 

interface About {
  general: General;
}
 
interface General {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  version: Version;
}
 
interface Version {
  versionNumber: number;
}

The resulting code is a little longer, but we addressed the problems with a big interface: 
we can now read our code easier with named types and we can reuse the smaller interfaces in other places in our code.

Composing types together is an essential way to keep our code organized and flexible.
