Deep Types
----------
...
To type an object nested inside another object, we could write an interface like this:

interface Robot {
  about: {
    general: {
      id: number;
      name: string;
    };
  };
  getRobotId: () => string;
}

Notice that within the Robot interface, the general typed object is nested inside the about typed object. 
TypeScript allows us to infinitely nest objects so that we can describe data correctly.
