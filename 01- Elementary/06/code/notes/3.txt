Void Return Type
----------------
... it is often preferred to use type annotations for functions, 
even when those functions don’t return anything. 
Example:

function logGreeting(name: string) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}

The function logGreeting() simply logs a greeting to the console. 
There is no returned value, so we must treat the return type as void. 

A proper type annotation for this function would look like this:

function logGreeting(name: string): void {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
